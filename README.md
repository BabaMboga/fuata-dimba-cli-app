## Description
Fuata Dimba is an application that provides detailed information to users on players, teams and coaches that they wish to access. It offers the fan a chance to stay up dated on current football data and allows them to get personalised data based on provided football statistics in the database. This eliminates the need for the user to access too many sources and get flooded with too much information that the player may not fully comprehend or need. We here at Fuata Dimba want the fan to have a more personalised football experience that not only leaves them satisfied but more knowledgable.

Fuata Dimba uses a personalised database with three distinct tables namely: coaches, teams and players that is regularly updated with current data.

The fan is able to:
- view all teams
